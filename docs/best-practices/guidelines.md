# Prompt Engineering Best Practices

## General Guidelines

### 1. Be Specific and Clear

**❌ Avoid:**
```
"Help me with my presentation"
```

**✅ Better:**
```
"Help me create an outline for a 15-minute presentation about renewable energy benefits for a corporate audience, including 3 main points and supporting data suggestions."
```

### 2. Provide Sufficient Context

**❌ Avoid:**
```
"Fix this code"
```

**✅ Better:**
```
"Fix this Python function that should calculate compound interest but is returning incorrect values. The function should take principal, rate, and time as parameters:

[code here]

Expected: $1,628.89 for principal=$1000, rate=5%, time=10 years
Actual: $1,500.00"
```

### 3. Use Examples When Helpful

**Few-shot prompting example:**
```
"Convert these product names to URL-friendly slugs:

Product: 'Premium Coffee Beans (Dark Roast)'
Slug: premium-coffee-beans-dark-roast

Product: 'Wireless Bluetooth Headphones - Noise Cancelling'
Slug: wireless-bluetooth-headphones-noise-cancelling

Product: 'Organic Green Tea & Honey Blend'
Slug:"
```

### 4. Structure Your Prompts

Use clear sections for complex prompts:

```
**Role:** You are an experienced UX designer

**Task:** Review this mobile app wireframe and provide feedback

**Context:** This is for a food delivery app targeting busy professionals

**Focus Areas:**
- Navigation clarity
- User flow efficiency
- Accessibility considerations

**Output Format:** 
- List of issues (if any)
- Specific improvement suggestions
- Overall rating (1-10)
```

## Domain-Specific Best Practices

### Writing and Content Creation

1. **Specify tone and style**
   ```
   "Write in a conversational, friendly tone suitable for a blog audience"
   ```

2. **Define target audience**
   ```
   "Target audience: Small business owners with limited technical knowledge"
   ```

3. **Set length constraints**
   ```
   "Write a 300-word article with 3 main sections"
   ```

4. **Include SEO requirements**
   ```
   "Include the keyword 'sustainable packaging' 3-4 times naturally"
   ```

### Code and Technical Tasks

1. **Specify programming language and version**
   ```
   "Write a Python 3.9+ function using type hints"
   ```

2. **Include requirements and constraints**
   ```
   "The function should handle edge cases and include error handling"
   ```

3. **Provide expected input/output**
   ```
   "Input: list of integers
   Output: dictionary with frequency counts
   Example: [1,2,2,3] → {1:1, 2:2, 3:1}"
   ```

4. **Mention coding standards**
   ```
   "Follow PEP 8 style guidelines and include docstrings"
   ```

### Data Analysis

1. **Describe data structure**
   ```
   "The dataset contains 1000 rows with columns: date, sales, region, product"
   ```

2. **Specify analysis goals**
   ```
   "Identify seasonal trends and top-performing regions"
   ```

3. **Request specific outputs**
   ```
   "Provide summary statistics, visualizations suggestions, and key insights"
   ```

### Business and Professional

1. **Define business context**
   ```
   "For a B2B SaaS company with 50-200 employee target market"
   ```

2. **Specify stakeholder audience**
   ```
   "This report will be presented to C-level executives"
   ```

3. **Include industry considerations**
   ```
   "Consider healthcare industry regulations and compliance requirements"
   ```

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Prompt Chaining

Break complex tasks into sequential steps:

```
Step 1: "Analyze this customer feedback data and identify the top 5 complaint categories"

Step 2: "For each complaint category identified, suggest specific improvement actions"

Step 3: "Prioritize these improvements based on impact and implementation difficulty"
```

### 2. Conditional Logic

Use if-then statements for dynamic responses:

```
"Review this code and:
- If there are syntax errors, list them with line numbers
- If the code is syntactically correct but has logical issues, explain the problems
- If the code is correct, suggest optimizations
- If the code is already optimal, confirm this and explain why"
```

### 3. Multi-Perspective Analysis

```
"Analyze this business proposal from three perspectives:
1. Financial analyst: Focus on ROI and cost-benefit
2. Risk manager: Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies
3. Operations manager: Assess implementation feasibility

Provide a summary recommendation based on all three perspectives."
```

### 4. Iterative Refinement

```
"Create a marketing email for our new product. After you provide the first draft, I'll give you feedback, and then you can create an improved version."
```

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Your Prompts

1. **Test with edge cases**
   - Empty inputs
   - Unusual formats
   - Extreme values

2. **Verify consistency**
   - Run the same prompt multiple times
   - Check for consistent quality

3. **Test across different models**
   - Different AI models may respond differently
   - Adjust prompts for optimal performance

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Vague responses | Add more specific instructions |
| Wrong format | Explicitly specify output format |
| Incomplete answers | Break into smaller, focused prompts |
| Inconsistent quality | Add examples and constraints |
| Off-topic responses | Provide clearer context and boundaries |

## Ethical Considerations

### 1. Avoid Harmful Content
- Don't request content that could cause harm
- Be mindful of bias in prompts
- Consider the impact of generated content

### 2. Respect Privacy
- Don't include personal or sensitive information
- Be cautious with proprietary data
- Follow data protection guidelines

### 3. Transparency
- Be clear about AI-generated content
- Don't misrepresent AI capabilities
- Acknowledge limitations

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Token Efficiency
- Remove unnecessary words
- Use clear, concise language
- Avoid repetition

### 2. Response Time
- Shorter prompts generally process faster
- Break complex tasks into smaller parts
- Use appropriate model for the task

### 3. Cost Management
- Monitor token usage
- Optimize prompt length
- Use caching for repeated queries

## Continuous Improvement

### 1. Document What Works
- Keep a library of effective prompts
- Note which variations perform better
- Track success metrics

### 2. Stay Updated
- Follow AI model updates
- Learn from community best practices
- Experiment with new techniques

### 3. Gather Feedback
- Get user feedback on outputs
